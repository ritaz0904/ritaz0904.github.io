excerpt: 'We study axisymmetric solutions to the wave equation on extremal Kerr backgrounds and obtain integrated local energy decay (or Morawetz estimates) through an analysis \textit{exclusively in physical-space}. Boundedness of the energy and Morawetz estimates for axisymmetric waves in extremal Kerr were first obtained by Aretakis through the construction of frequency-localized currents used in particular to express the trapping degeneracy. Here we extend to extremal Kerr a method introduced by Stogin in the sub-extremal case, simplifying Aretakis' derivation of Morawetz estimates through purely classical currents.'
