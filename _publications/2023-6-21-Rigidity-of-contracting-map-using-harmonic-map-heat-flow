Motivated by the recent work of Tsai-Tsui-Wang, we consider the rigidity of map between compact manifolds with positive curvature. We show that distance non-increasing map between complex projective spaces is either an isometry or homotopically trivial. The rigidity result also holds on a wider class of manifolds with positive curvature and weaker contracting property on the map in between distance non-increasing and area non-increasing. This is based on the harmonic map heat flow.
