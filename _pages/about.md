🧑‍🎓 I am a fourth year graduate student at Columbia University, supervised by both [Professor Mu-Tao Wang](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~mtwang/) and [Professor Elena Giorgi](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~egiorgi/). I was an undergraduate student in Hong Kong University of Science and technology, supervised by [Professor Frederick Fong](https://frederickfong.me).


More about me
======

✨ My research interests are differential geometry, partial differential equation, general relativity and so on, especially various aspects of Blackholes.

📃 So far, my appeared works are about positive curved manifolds, geometric/heat flows or wave equations. See my [PUBLICATIONS LIST](https://jingbowanmath.github.io/publications/).

🧑‍🏫 For seminars and talks, I co-organized two seminars in the past two semesters: one about [Scalar Curvature and Topology](https://math.columbia.edu/~axu/seminars/scalar-curvature-seminar-post/), another one about [dihedral rigidity](http://math.columbia.edu/~ypharry/seminar/dihedral-rigidity.html). For more talks I gave, see my [TALKS LIST](https://jingbowanmath.github.io/talks/).
